At 40-years-old he has spent approximately half his life surviving in the streets and more than a decade in the Downtown Eastside.

He sends love to his six-year-old son, Money.</p></div>

<p>Danielle was born missing her right arm at the elbow. As an adult, she learned that this was most likely due to a condition called "amniotic banding”. Danielle currently works full time in marketing and communications for a busy nonprofit social service agency, and sits on the board of directors for an association for communications professionals. She also lives with her partner, Grant, and in the future would like to complete a master's degree in communications. While being born without an arm hasn't stopped Danielle from pursuing what she’s wanted in life, it has been a source of internal conflict. She doesn’t want to be treated differently because of her arm, but she does want others to understand that it sometimes takes hard work to make it look like it’s not a big deal.</p></div>
